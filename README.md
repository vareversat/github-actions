# github-actions 🚀

A curated collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows organized by programming language and technology stack, plus general-purpose workflows for common development tasks.

```

## Naming Convention 📝

All workflow files follow this naming pattern:
```
[language/category]/[command].yml
```

For example:
- `go/test.yml`
- `flutter/test.yml`
- `general/release.yml`

## Usage 💡

To use these workflows in your projects, add a new workflow file in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory with the following structure:

```yml
name: Call a reusable workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: vareversat/github-actions/.github/workflows/go/lint.yml@main
    with:
      # Add any required inputs here
      parameter1: value1
      parameter2: value2
```
